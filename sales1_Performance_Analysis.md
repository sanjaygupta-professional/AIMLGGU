## Key Observations

### Productivity Analysis
- **Moderate Performance:** 73.4% productivity within acceptable range
- **High Volatility:** 46.4% CV indicates severe instability in delivery patterns

### Predictability Analysis
- **Moderate Predictability:** 68.0% predictability indicates room for improvement

### Inflation Pattern
- **Clean Estimation:** No inflation corrections needed

### Sprint Notes

- **S25.13:** test-only stories make the amount of SP delivered higher (also last year), they are taken into account for the calculation because this practice continues
- **S25.14:** high reliability on Joris to finish stories (might improve with Joost coming back)
- **S25.15:** moving stories?
